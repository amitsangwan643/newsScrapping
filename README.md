"# NewsScrapper" 

In this project , News are Scrapped from 3 different websites and displayed on our own designed html page.

The three websites used for scrapping news are :

1. Hindi News website - AmarUjala URL - https://www.amarujala.com/
2. Cricket website - Cricbuzz URL - https://www.cricbuzz.com/
3. Technology News website - Gadget360 URL - https://gadgets.ndtv.com/

After Scrapping the news from websites these news are displayed on html page created by me.

This project can also be deployed on Cloud Platforms like Heroku , AWS , GCP , Azure etc.
